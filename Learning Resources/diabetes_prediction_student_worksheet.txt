UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT WORKSHEET: PREDICTING DIABETES USING MACHINE LEARNING

INSTRUCTIONS:
Read the outputs from the notebook including the confusion matrix, feature importance, and precision-recall curve.
Answer the questions below in your own words. Use the notebook to guide your thinking.

---

SECTION 1: MODEL EVALUATION

1. According to the confusion matrix:
   a. How many diabetic patients did the model correctly identify?
   b. How many diabetic cases did it miss?
   c. What do we call these two types of outcomes?

2. The model predicts 86% accuracy. Is that a complete measure of performance? Why or why not?

3. Compare the precision and recall for class 1 (diabetic). Which is higher? What does this suggest?

---

SECTION 2: FEATURE INTERPRETATION

4. What were the top three most important features in predicting diabetes?

5. Do these features make sense biologically? Explain why or why not.

6. Can you think of any features that might be missing from the dataset that could improve predictions?

SECTION 3: PRECISION-RECALL CURVE

7. What is the purpose of the precision-recall curve in this analysis?

8. The average precision (AP) was reported as 0.35. What does this mean in practical terms?

9. How does the shape of the precision-recall curve reflect the modelâ€™s performance on diabetic patients?

SECTION 4: CRITICAL THINKING

10. What are the ethical implications of using an imperfect model for diagnosing real patients?

11. If you were to improve this model, what steps might you take next (e.g., more data, feature engineering, algorithm tuning)?
